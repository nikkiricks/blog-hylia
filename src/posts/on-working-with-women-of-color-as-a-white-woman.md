Do you read [Cup of Jo](https://cupofjo.com/)? I’ve been obsessed for 10 years. Joanna does this fantastic style series “[A Week of Outfits.](https://cupofjo.com/category/style/)” One of them featured [April Kae](https://cupofjo.com/2017/10/april-kae-imanigold-style-outfits/) and I loved her approachable, effortlessly cool, layered style so I headed over to her [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/loveaprilkae/) and clicked the follow button. I'm so glad I did as I have been inspired by not just her style but her activist voice and powerful presence. ⁣\
⁣\
Last year, in August, she [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl6Da1XBiIb/) this.

It inspired me and I wanted to reach out to her, but I was nervous, not really knowing if I would say something wrong, or maybe the whole point of her post was to collaborate with women of color and not white people, and was I missing the point? ⁣\
⁣\
I decided to email anyway. I told her how I worked with women businesses and that I wanted to work with more women of color and asked if she knew anyone that needed help. ⁣\
⁣\
I’m so glad I did.⁣\
⁣\
She responded enthusiastically which sparked ongoing conversations that stretched, challenged, and made me cry - in the best way possible. ⁣We talked about how I could help more women of color, what that could look like, how to talk about it, what to say, what not to say, I read a lot, reached out to people, and joined FB groups. ⁣\
⁣\
I know there are plenty of women of color that can afford my services, money is not really the point. The point is that POC have been systematically held back and continue to be, and I want to do my part in acknowledging that, creating a safe place, helping people feel seen, and giving a boost of encouragement.⁣ I’m also not trying to be a white savior or charitable, but be an advocate for justice. ⁣

This isn’t a pretty conversation, I know I don’t have the right words. But if you are a woman of color or someone you know is and needs help, please reach out. Let’s chat, and see what we can make work. ⁣
