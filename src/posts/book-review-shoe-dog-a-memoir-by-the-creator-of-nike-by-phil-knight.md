This month I'm covering [Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike](https://amzn.to/2Ha64To) by Phil Knight. I chose this book because there was quite a lot of buzz around it and Nike has always been a leader in the industry. But I will say, I came away super disappointed. I’m a minority it has 4.8 stars out of 2,716 reviews. So you may not want to take my word for it.

Here’s my review in **4** takeaways:

### Takeaway #1 - I smell a ghost writer

Maybe, maaayyyybe this is Knight voice in real life. But the writing sounded so contrived that 1 page into it I googled, “[shoe dog ghost writer](https://www.google.com/search?q=shoe+dog+ghost+writer&oq=shoe+dog+ghost+writer&aqs=chrome..69i57.234j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)” and was oddly enough quickly able to find that [J. R. Moehringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Moehringer) was the actual writer behind the words.

Sure, ghost writing is very common and I don’t really care, but the fact that I could sniff it out so quickly was bothersome.

### Takeaway #2 - Should I stop wearing Nike?

I’ve never read a memoir and ended up not liking the person. Isn’t that kind of the point of story telling is that we understand the persons point of view, empathize, and leave better by having a broader understanding of the human experience?

In 2011, I had a conscious conflict after reading [Steve Jobs](https://amzn.to/2PWYPRx) by Walter Isaacson. Thinking to myself, “should get rid of all my Apple products?” He was such a manipulative human, hurt, and screwed over a lot of people, that using his products and praising him felt like supporting that behavior.

I woke up one morning to put on my black Nikes hesitated and thought, “should I stop wearing these?” Here are some of the things that I just rubbed me the wrong way about Knight:

* obsession with “war” and being a “warrior”
* forces “play” as his “why” but is stressed and uptight most of the time, and even in the moments he is running it’s more about winning and ego than playing
* his admitted lack of attention and encouragement to his employees
* his preference for people with ivy league education, lawyers and accountants because they “could pass hard tests”
* the team meetings they would refer to as “the buttheads” (this is a real thing, cue the chauvinism, and in recent news about [Allyson Felix,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/opinion/allyson-felix-pregnancy-nike.html) still exists today)
* his regret for his lack of time with his sons but doesn’t make any real lasting change to fix it
* unethical business practices by American standards but rationalized in Japan with ‘it’s just the way they do things there’ (he hired an internal spy, yes, a spy)

### Takeaway #3 - What did Knight do?

All the things that are so inspiring about Nike have nothing to do with Knight, the sleek logo, the tag line, the gorgeous and innovative design. Logo - an accident, he didn’t even really like it, they were just on a deadline. The famous “just do it” tagline - not even mentioned in the book, maybe I missed it? The innovative design of the shoe - that was all thanks to his cofounder [Bill Bowerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bowerman).

**Rating: 2/5**

**Recommendation**: Maybe good for men in their 60’s who care about winning over everything else.
