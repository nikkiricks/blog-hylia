I started the GA Software Engineering Immersive in Melbourne September 30, 2019 and completed it December 20, 209. Every week I wrote about my experience in a quick tweet. Here's the culmination of those insights. 🤗 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick thoughts after finishing week 1 (of 12) in <a href="https://twitter.com/MelbourneGA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MelbourneGA</a> SEI bootcamp. -🙌super happy with the teachers, (great mix of humor and knowledge) -🤓learning the power of js, loops, functions, arrays -🗄i feel confident in command line -📝fun to play around with markdown</p>&mdash; nikkiricks she/her (@nikkiricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkiricks/status/1180802652268941313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I didn’t know what I was getting myself into….

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/12 week SEI recap: HTML, CSS (flexbox🙌), layouts. ▶️ functions in functions. ↩️DOM 👂🏾 event listeners.

Those were happy days. Although the bank balance app did give me a run for my money (pun intended).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3/12 week SEI recap. Made my first app. Felt good to make something on my own! Tic-tac-🦷. Still working on mobile responsive design. And I’m wanting to write more sophisticated JavaScript as well. WIP.

I still stand behind the design concept… I don’t stand behind the code. And if I’m being honest, I’m scared to revisit this project. Let’s just say it’s a good example to show “how far I’ve come” haha.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/12 week code school recap. 💎 getting into Ruby, learning about gems, apis, and Sinatra. 🎛📲Delved into server side programming. ⚖️🎥Made Ruby apps using stock database and movie database.</p>&mdash; nikkiricks she/her (@nikkiricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkiricks/status/1187917720102162432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Working with API’s was really rewarding. I still don’t *quite* understand why people give it away for free…

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5/12 SEI recap: more 💎 ruby! 🗄SQL. 🤫Passwords, ✏️made a CRUD app, deployed on <a href="https://twitter.com/heroku?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@heroku</a>.

Now this is where I started to feel like I could make a serious app on my own. I’ve always wanted to figure out how to make a user database. Which is difficult as someone who has only used wordpress and drag and drop sites (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify). So this week got me really excited.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6/12 SEI week recap: I made my first 💎 Ruby CRUD app! It’s a ratings and reviews site on startup investors. Complete with , signup/login using 🔒 bcrypt, user sessions, PSQL database with three tables that talk to one another. Let me know what you think! <a href="https://t.co/otfHIYfZc6">https://t.co/otfHIYfZc6</a></p>&mdash; nikkiricks she/her (@nikkiricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkiricks/status/1192925956521902080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Although the app was in Sinatra, and I would do this in Rails now I still am very proud of this project! I implemented all that I had learned so far in the class, stuck to concentrating on structuring my tables, and the ability to CRUD all of them.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">7/12 SEI week recap: Went over jQuery, AJAX, test driven development (TDD). Really enjoying asynchronous apps rather than the need to refresh a page. As a user a refresh feels too hard. I will opt for a pop-up box anyday over being sent to another page.</p>&mdash; nikkiricks she/her (@nikkiricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkiricks/status/1195888352102236160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I’ve since learned that jQuery is a bit outdated and React is what all the cool kids use.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8/12 SEI recap. We went over more OOP, Ruby on Rails, refactoring, active record 🙌(amazing after just doing SQL), RESTful apps, referential integrity, maps api, creating our own api... still loving it, 🥰 but I’m getting a little information overload. Trying to pace myself. 🏃‍♀️</p>&mdash; nikkiricks she/her (@nikkiricks) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikkiricks/status/1198890313701396481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

“getting a little information overload” aka:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SEI 9/12 week recap: first group project! Eek, git fetch, rebase, force push, pull, oh my! Made a travel app with google oauth, maps, calendar, and places.

I realise that working with a group is real world — but oy vey version control! My group was awesome, and I learned from them a ton. It was fun to work with google API’s.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10/12 SEI week recap: node.js, react, making a 🍔 builder app, and oyher extremely useful things. My 🧠 feels like it’s shrinking.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">11/12 SEI week recap: learned more about rails, 💎 specifically with forms.

No comment.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Week 12/12 of the software engineering bootcamp! I presented my node bot that can send a text in a click of a button. And a screen that tells you eckhart tolle time “now”. NOW WHO NEEDS A JUNIOR DEV ON THEIR TEAM?

It was really rewarding creating my final project with NodeBots, something that we didn’t go over in class at all. Working with hardware after being in software for so long was refreshing.

Overall, I really loved my time at GA and highly recommend it (with some caveats, email me).

Now on to finding a job!
